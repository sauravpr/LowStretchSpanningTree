# Low Stretch Spanning Tree
Implementation of weighted and unweighted low stretch spanning trees, written as one part of my final year dissertation based on pseudocode provided [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0411064.pdf) by Elkin et al.

Given a NetworkX graph, G, one can generate the resulting low stretch spanning tree i.e. a spanning tree where the distance between any two nodes in G is not increased too much in T.
